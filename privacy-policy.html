                                access or disclosure of Information we have physical, electronic and managerial
                                procedures in place to keep your information safe. Once logged into your OmniCard ®
                                account, all internet communication is secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS)
                                technology and the connection is encrypted and authenticated using AES 128bit encryption

                                However, this high level of protection can only be effective if you follow certain
                                security practices yourself. You must never share your OmniCard ® account or login
                                details with anyone. If you are concerned that any of your login details have been
                                compromised, you can change them any time once you are logged on but you should always
                                also immediately contact customer services at <a href="mailto:care@omnicard.in">care@omnicard.in</a> or OmniCard Helpdesk and
                                tell us why you think your login details have been compromised. Please read our Terms
                                and Conditions for further information on how to keep your OmniCard account safe.

                                environment that is not open to the public, you should understand that there is no such
                                thing as complete security, and we do not guarantee that there will be no unintended
                                disclosures of your Information. If we become aware that your Information has been
