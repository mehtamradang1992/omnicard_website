                            <p>We may provide the functionality to load your Wallet through debit card, credit card or
                                any other payment mode and collect data in relation to such loading of your Wallet
                                through these payment modes (“Payment Data”). The information regarding your Payment
                                Data may be stored once you make the first payment by the card/other payment mode and is
                                protected against unauthorized access. For this purpose, a certified payment provider is
                                used whose systems meet the applicable security standards, such as for example PCI-DSS
                                (Payment Card Industry – Data Security Standard). The Payment Data is stored by the
                                contracted PCI-DSS-certified payment provider for recurring transactions. We do not,
                                ourselves, store your Payment Data and if we ever do, it will be only in abbreviated
                                form for analysis purposes or to prevent fraud.</p>
                            <p>In order to ensure that the debit/credit card/other payment mode is used by the
                                legitimate owner and to prevent cases of fraud, the Payment Data and card information is
                                transferred to one or more external payment security services. This transfer may also
                                include additional personal data. The external payment security services may process
                                personal data on our behalf. </p>

                                protection to your personal data which is commensurate to the risk, taking into account
                                state of the art technologies, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and
                                purposes of processing as well as the risk of likelihood and the degree of risk. The
                                transfer of personal data between your end device and us is generally carried out in an
                                encrypted form (TLS encryption). You can identify an encrypted connection by the lock
                                symbol in the address line of your browser. If you communicate with us by email, access
                                by third parties cannot be ruled out. In the case of confidential information, we
