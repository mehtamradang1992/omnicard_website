                                    the supervision of their parents/guardians from a young age. But, users below the
                                    age
                                    of 18 years (“Minor(s)”) can use the Platform only with the permission and under the
                                    supervision of their parent or legally appointed guardian (“Parent”). As the Parent
                                    you must agree to and accept these Terms and the Privacy Policy
                                    on behalf of the Minor(s). Minors cannot, therefore, use the Platform unless their
                                    Parent agrees to and accepts these Terms and the Privacy Policy on their behalf. If
                                    you agree to these Terms and the Privacy Policy on behalf of a Minor(s),
                                    you represent to us that you are their Parent. As a Parent, you agree to take full
                                    financial and legal responsibility for the acts and omissions of the Minor(s). A
                                    Minor’s use of the Services and interaction with the Platform must
                                    be supervised by the Parent. As a Parent you must take full responsibility for a
                                    Minor(s) actions while using the Services and any interaction with the Platform,
                                    such as – setting up and using the OmniCard Account or Wallet Account,
                                    creating and adding members to a Pool account (defined below). This is a crucial
                                    obligation, so we advise you not to add individuals to your pool account who you do
                                    not know or want to take responsibility for.

                                    Inquiries as to Minors: By taking responsibility for a Minor, you authorize us to
                                    make inquiries (if we choose to do so), either directly or through third parties to
                                    validate the information provided about the Minor or your relationship with the
                                    Minor.
                                    This could include information to verify your relationship as a Parent to the
                                    Minor(s). If we are unable to verify the information that you provide, we may: (i)
                                    refuse to establish a OmniCard Account (defined below) and, or, Wallet
                                    Account for the Minor; (ii) close the OmniCard Account and/or, Wallet Account of a
                                    Minor; (iii) close the Parent’s OmniCard Account and/or, Wallet Account; and/or (iv)
                                    terminate our Services or portion(s) thereof.

                                    we will authenticate with a one-time password). You must also permit OmniCard to

                                    KYC requirement: As per RBI Regulations, the Eroute can issue you a Wallet only if
                                    you comply with the KYC requirements or provide us with the ‘minimum details’ about
                                    yourself. Whether you can use all or some of the Wallet’s features depends on
                                    whether
                                    you have provided minimum details (about yourself) or if you have completed full KYC

                                    What is a Pool Account: The Platform will allow you to create a pool account. You
                                    can create a “Pool Account” with an adult, other adult members and Minor(s). But a
                                    Pool Account must have an adult (who agrees to these Terms on behalf of the Minor

                                    of the pool account). You must keep your contact information in the pool account
                                    complete and accurate at all times. You can request us to delete your pool account
                                    at any time, through the primary adult member of the pool account,
                                    but you must withdraw all funds from your Pool Account (defined below) before you
                                    go. Any activity on a pool account is the responsibility of the primary adult

                                    What is a Pool Account: The “Pool Account” is the Wallet issued to the Primary adult
                                    member in a pool (or a sub-limit within the Wallet issued to the adult). Every
                                    member of a pool account (whether adult or Minor), can access and use funds in the
                                    Pool
                                    account. The features of the Pool account will depend on the type of wallet it is
                                    (refer to clause 5 of these Terms for detailed features of the different types of
                                    Wallets). Members of a can view the transaction history of their Pool
                                    account. The primary member of the pool account must monitor the Minors’ use and
                                    access to the Pool account. The primary member of a account is liable for any
                                    financial transactions, use, access to the Pool account by Minors of such
                                    account.

                                    Apart from the Pool account, any other Wallet held by a member of a pool account is
                                    accessible only to the holder of this instrument.

                                    What is a Card: We may offer you a virtual card linked to your Wallet on the
                                    Platform (“Virtual Card”) and give you the option to request for a physical card
                                    (associated to your Wallet) (“Physical Card”). You may use these to make payments at
                                    merchants;
                                    this of course depends on the type of Wallet you have been issued. You may disable
                                    these cards at any time, through the Platform. You may use your Virtual Card or
                                    Physical Card to spend from both, the pool account and your personal
                                    Wallet within these prescribed limits. You cannot sell or transfer the Physical
                                    Card. We may cancel, repossess, or revoke your Physical Card (at any time without
                                    prior notice) subject to Applicable Law. We may also refuse to process
                                    any transaction which we believe may violate these Terms.

                                    we may prescribe from time to time). Eroute also provides and maintains the Platform
                                    which acts as an interface through which you can access your Wallet Account.

                                    solely held by Eroute. Therefore, when you send funds, receive funds, or make
                                    payments to merchants,
                                    Eroute debits or credits your account based on the instructions you send through the
                                    Platform.

                                    1.  No Cash Value or Transferability. Points do not constitute property, do not
                                    entitle a member to a vested right or interest and have no cash value. As such,
                                    Points are not redeemable for cash, transferable or assignable for any reason.
                                    Accordingly,
                                    Points are not transferable (a) upon death, (b) as part of a domestic relations
                                    matter, (c) from separate Rewards Accounts held by one Participant, or (d) otherwise
                                    by operation of law. The sale or transfer of Points is strictly prohibited.
                                    Points may not be sold on any secondary market, and any transfer of Points to a
                                    secondary market shall be deemed void.  Any Points remaining in a Participant’s
                                    Rewards Account if the Program is canceled will be forfeited without compensation.
                                    There shall be no carry over or transfer of Points to other Sponsor programs, unless
                                    otherwise determined by Sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    2. Point Expiration. Every set of Points earned will have its expiration, applicable
                                    after they are earned.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    3. Accrued Points Viewable in Participant’s Rewards Account. The number of Points
                                    collected by each Participant will be tracked in the Participant’s Eroute Rewards
                                    Account. Points will be credited to Participant’s Rewards Account after (i)
                                    transaction
                                    confirmation; (ii) the applicable return period has lapsed; and/or (iii) the
                                    applicable chargeback window has closed.  However, each Participant will have the
                                    responsibility of ensuring that his/her Points are properly credited. Any
                                    claim for Points not credited accurately must be received by Sponsor within seven
                                    (7) days of the date of claimed accrual of such Points. Manual issuance of Points
                                    can take up to sixty (60) days.  Sponsor shall have no liability for
                                    any printing, production, typographical, mechanical or other errors in the Points
                                    summaries or Participant Reward Account. Sponsor reserves the right to invalidate
                                    Points from a Participant Rewards Account if it determines that such
                                    Points were improperly credited or obtained fraudulently. Sponsor reserves the right
                                    to require proof of accrual of Points and Sponsor reserves the right to delay the
                                    processing or redemption of any Points without notice to Participants
                                    in order to assure compliance with these Rules. Participants are responsible for
                                    maintaining the confidentiality of their Participant Rewards Accounts and passwords
                                    and for restricting access to their Devices and activity on their
                                    Participant Rewards Account, and Participants agree to accept responsibility for all
                                    activities that occur under their Rewards Account. Without limiting any other
                                    remedies, Sponsor may suspend or terminate a Participant’s Reward Account
                                    if Sponsor suspects that a Participant has engaged in fraudulent activity in
                                    connection with the Program. Participation in the Program is subject to these Rules,
                                    as well as policies and procedures that Sponsor may adopt or modify from
                                    time to time. Any failure to abide by these Rules or any policies or procedures
                                    implemented by Sponsor, any conduct detrimental to Sponsor, or any misrepresentation
                                    or fraudulent activities in connection with the Program may result,
                                    in addition to any rights or remedies available to Sponsor in law or equity, in the
                                    termination of participation in the Program, as well as forfeiture of Points accrued
                                    to date, all as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion.

                                    1. Sponsor reserves the right to suspend or discontinue the eligibility of any
                                    person who uses, or, in the case of suspension, is suspected of using, the Program
                                    in a manner inconsistent with these Rules or any federal or state laws, statutes or
